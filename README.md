# About

DepictX provides a lightweight, easy-to-use, and efficient 2D graphics library. It supports drawing 2D graphic elements such as lines, circles, rectangles, text, etc., as well as some commonly used advanced graphic effects such as gradient, anti-aliasing, and shadow. With DepictX, elements created can be used just like natively created DOM elements. DepictX is also well-suited for integration into web applications because it can easily integrate with JavaScript.
