# About

DepictX provides a lightweight, easy-to-use, and efficient 2D graphics library. It supports drawing 2D graphic elements such as lines, circles, rectangles, text, etc., as well as some commonly used advanced graphic effects such as gradient, anti-aliasing, and shadow. With DepictX, elements created can be used just like natively created DOM elements. DepictX is also well-suited for integration into web applications because it can easily integrate with JavaScript.

This library will support more features in the future, making it suitable for use as an underlying library for collaborative documents that involve constructing graphics, or as an underlying library for spreadsheets.
